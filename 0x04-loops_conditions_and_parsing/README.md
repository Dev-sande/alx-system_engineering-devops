The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash is portability. By using #!/usr/bin/env bash, you allow the system to search for the Bash interpreter in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. This means that the script will still work even if Bash is installed in a different location on different systems. It provides more flexibility and makes your script more portable across different environments.
