The regular expression library used by Ruby by default is called Onigmo (short for Oniguruma-mod). Onigmo is an enhanced version of the Oniguruma regular expression library, which provides powerful pattern matching and manipulation capabilities.

Onigmo is known for its support of various regular expression features, including Unicode character properties, character encoding, and advanced syntax. It is highly optimized and provides efficient pattern matching for complex regular expressions.

Ruby has integrated Onigmo as its default regular expression engine since version 2.0. With Onigmo, Ruby developers can perform sophisticated pattern matching and text manipulation operations using regular expressions.
