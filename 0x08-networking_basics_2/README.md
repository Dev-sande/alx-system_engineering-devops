"localhost" and "127.0.0.1" are both used to refer to the loopback address of a device. The loopback address is a virtual network interface that allows a device to communicate with itself. When you access "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" on your machine, you are connecting to the network services running on your own device. It is commonly used for testing and accessing local resources.

"0.0.0.0" is a special IP address used to represent all IPv4 addresses on the local machine or network. It is often used as a placeholder or wildcard address, indicating that a service or application should listen on all available network interfaces or bind to any address.

"/etc/hosts" is a file found in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux) that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is a local database used for hostname resolution before querying DNS servers. Entries in the "/etc/hosts" file allow you to override DNS lookups and specify custom IP-address-to-hostname mappings.

To display your machine's active network interfaces, you can use the following commands depending on your operating system:

1. On Windows:
   Open the command prompt or PowerShell and run the command:
   ```
   ipconfig
   ```
   This will display the IP configuration details for all active network interfaces on your machine.

2. On Linux:
   Open the terminal and run the command:
   ```
   ifconfig
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use the `ip` command:
   ```
   ip addr
   ```
   Both commands will provide information about the active network interfaces, including their IP addresses, subnet masks, and other details.

3. On macOS:
   Open the terminal and run the command:
   ```
   ifconfig
   ```
   This will display the active network interfaces along with their configuration details, similar to the Linux `ifconfig` command.
